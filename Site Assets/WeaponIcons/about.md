# Where are the Icons?
I purchased the SVG icons used in the demo from ICONFINDER. Unfortunately, the license does not allow me to share with others, so if you want to use the exact icons I used, you'll need to purchase them from here: [Weapon Icons on iconfinder.com](https://www.iconfinder.com/collections/collection/1935353?utm_source=sharing-feature&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=sharing-feature&utm_content=link)

Otherwise, you'll need to find substitutes.
